      <h3>Why Korea?</h3>
         <p>Ever since I was in highschool, I've been interested in Korean mediia. 
            I was an avid listner to Korean music and watch a lot of Korean dramas. 
            But I got more into the cultutal aspect in college. In college I majored in International Studies with a focus on East Asia.
            With my major I learned topics on Korean history, economics, media, and culture. I also took years of Korean language courses. </p>
