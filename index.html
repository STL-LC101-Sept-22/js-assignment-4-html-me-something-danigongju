         <h2>Why Korea?</h2>
            <p>
            Ever since I was in highschool, I've been interested in Korean mediia. 
            I was an avid listner to Korean music and watch a lot of Korean dramas. 
            But I got more into the cultutal aspect in college. In college I majored in International Studies with a focus on East Asia.
            With my major I learned topics on Korean history, economics, media, and culture. I also took two years of Korean language courses. 
            My major also led me to study abroud in Korea. I spent two summers in Korea for study abroad and they really some of the best memories I have today.

         <h2>My Life in Korea</h2>  
            <p>
             I moved to Korea in August of 2019 to become an English teacher through a Korean government program called TALK (Teach and Learn in Korea). 
             We went through an oreientation  to teach us the skills we would need to be succesful in the classroom. 
             After oreientation we were a assigned to an elementary school in various cities in Korea. 
             I was assigned to a small elementary school in a costal city called Yeosu.
             I was very nervous since I would be moving to this city by myself without any of my friends that also joined the program.
             I was also worried about being an effective teacher since it was my first experience with teaching, especially in a foreign country.
             However, I was lucky to have amazing teachers and staff at my school that made the transition a little easier for me by being very helpful and welcoming.
             I was also grateful for my students who were very receptive of me.
             And I didn't have to worry about being too lonely, since Korea's public transportation system is the most convienent and affordable I've ever seen, I was able to visit my friends in their cities often.
